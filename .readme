# KMM Clean code case study

This project shows how to share the common core of an iOS and Android 
project using Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile.

The use cases are incrementing and decrementing a number.

In the shared core you can find:
- Entities: Number.
- Use cases: Increment and decrement interactors.
- Presenters: Adapts the model to what the UI should display.

Any comments are welcome.
